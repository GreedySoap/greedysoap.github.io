# welcome to my webpage... 
If you want the code for it, even though you can copy it from the browser itself
## Proper use and what you can do with it
Please only use the non encrypted version to see how I did something, or just as a template/reference. Don't outright steal it.
## What you'll find in the files
You'll find the assets folder, all accessible pages in no way edited from the main site *and it isnt compressed*, a couple of trash css files that might help you, and a template file to create pages easily without needing to gut other pages *I did that*
